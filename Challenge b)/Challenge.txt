Challenge a)
- Create a `components` folder
- Create the following components in separate files inside
the components folder. in each one, just render an `h1`
with the name of the component (e.g. return <h1>Navbar goes here</h1>);
-Navbar
-Main
- Create an App component outside the components folder (Sibling to
the index.js file)
- Have App render the Navbar and Main components
- Import and render the App component inside of index.js using ReactDOM
- At this point you should have your "Navbar goes here" etc. showing up
in the mini-browser.
- Go to Google fonts and get the "Inter" font with weights 400,600, and 700.
put the links to those fonts ABOVE the style.css link in index,html (use
the `<link/>` elements instead of the @import or npm options for getting
the fonts. you may need to do some extra research to figure out how this
works if haven't done it before )

Challenge b)
Place the gray react logo in the background

Don't use an `img` element, but rather set it as the 
`background-image` of the `main` element.

Hint: you'll need to use the following properties:
- Background-image
- Background-repeat
- Background-position

(or the shorthand `backgorund` property with values for all
those other properties)
